# Flask Caesar Cipher

A web-based application that allows users to encode and decode messages using the Caesar Cipher technique, built with Python's Flask framework.

## Introduction

The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This application provides an easy-to-use interface that enables users to quickly encode or decode their messages.

## Features

- **Encode Messages**: Convert your plain text into encrypted text with a custom shift value.
- **Decode Messages**: Decrypt messages that were encrypted with a Caesar Cipher.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile browsers.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive web interface for easy operation.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Deployment**
